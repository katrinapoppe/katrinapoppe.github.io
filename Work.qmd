Here is a sampling of some of the things I've been working on.  

# Research & Field Work


Through my career I've done field work all over the world, from pine plantations in New Zealand to tundra sites in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories.  Presently, I am primarily focused on managing a collection of eddy covariance (EC) stations in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area in Delta, BC.

## Mobile BBS Flux Tower

In spring/summer 2023 I designed and deployed a light-weight EC system mounted on a telescoping tripod to measure CO<sub>2</sub>, water, and energy fluxes over a 7-year old stand of lodgepole pine seedlings in Burn's Bog that sprouted following a fire in 2016.  The tower will operate through the fall until the sun/cloud conditions become unfavorable for solar power generation.  We will restart observations in late winter 2024.

## Flux Footprint Mapping

I've developed a python based tool for creating flux footprints web maps using the Kljun et al. (2015) flux footprint prediction (FFP) model.  Given half-hourly turbulence conditions and metadata for a site, this wrapper will calculate the FFP on a per-time-step basis, and output FFP contours over desired intervals in this web-map format.  If provided a landscape classification map, the program will also overlay each timestep's footprint with the map.  This allows the user to estimate the relative source contrition of different ecosystem components in some heterogeneous ecosystems.  @fig-output shows an example of the web map output for the Burns Bog 2 EC station.  You can find more information and links to its github repository [here](https://june-skeeter.github.io/FFP_Overlay/).

For my PhD research, I studied carbon fluxes in wetland ecosystem in the Mackenzie Delta Region.  I conducted two field seasons of research.  In 2016 I worked at Illisarvik, an artificially drained thermokarst lake on Richard's Island, NWT.  Then in 2017 I installed an EC station at Fish Island, a low-center polygon ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta.
