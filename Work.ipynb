Given half-hourly turbulence conditions and metadata for a site, this wrapper will calculate the FFP on a per-time-step basis, and output FFP contours over desired intervals in this web-map format.  If provided a landscape classification map, the program will also overlay each timestep's footprint with the map.  This allows the user to estimate the relative source contrition of different ecosystem components in some heterogeneous ecosystems.  @fig-output shows an example of the web map output for the Burns Bog 2 EC station.  You can find more information and links to its github repository [here](https://june-skeeter.github.io/FFP_Overlay/). \n",
