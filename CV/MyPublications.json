		"abstract": "The Delmarva Peninsula is a unique region with regards to the importance of fog. This study examines the spatial and temporal variability of fog characteristics across the Peninsula. In this paper, we use five stations with reliable records to create a regional fog climatology. Results indicate there is a high degree of temporal variability over relatively short distances, especially when comparing coastal to inland locations. The most inland location, Salisbury, receives by far the greatest annual frequency of fog. The seasonal distribution of fog events for the inland and coastal locations differ greatly, with Salisbury experiencing its maximum fog frequency during the summer while locations near the coast experience their maxima during the winter. Numerous physiographic and meteorological factors combine in complex ways to create a unique fog climatology across the Peninsula The results of this study can be useful to help understand and anticipate potentially dangerous transportation conditions due to fog.",

		"abstract": "Growing season surface–atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and methane were quantified at Fish Island, a wetland site in the lower northeast Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada. The terrain consists of low-center polygonal tundra and is subject to infrequent flooding in high water years. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were continuously measured using eddy covariance and the relevance of different environmental controls were identified using neural networks. Net daily carbon dioxide uptake peaked in mid-July before gradually decreasing and transitioning to net daily emissions by September. Variations in light level and temperature were the main controls over diurnal net carbon dioxide uptake, whereas thaw depth and phenology were the main seasonal controls. Methane emissions measured at Fish Island were higher than comparable studies on river delta sites in the Arctic and were influenced by the interaction of a large number of factors including thaw and water table depth, soil temperatures, and net radiation. Spikes in methane emissions were associated with strong winds and turbulence. The Fish Island tundra was a net sink for carbon during the growing season and methane emissions only slightly reduced the overall sink strength.",

		"abstract": "A temporal upscaling study was conducted to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide and net methane exchange (NME) for a low-center polygon (LCP) ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta, for each of the 11 growing seasons (2009–2019). We used regression models to create a time series of flux drivers from in situ weather observations (2009–2019) combined with ERA5 reanalysis and satellite data. We then used neural networks that were trained and validated on a single growing season (2017) of eddy covariance data to model NEE and NME over each growing season. The study indicates growing season NEE was negative (net uptake) and NME was positive (net emission) in this LCP ecosystem. Cumulative carbon (C) uptake was estimated to be −46.7 g C m−2 (CI95% ± 45.3) per growing season, with methane emissions offsetting an average 5.6% of carbon dioxide uptake (in g C m−2) per growing season. High air temperatures (>15 °C) reduced daily CO2 uptake and cumulative NEE was positively correlated with mean air growing season temperatures. Cumulative NME was positively correlated with the length of the growing season. Our analysis suggests warmer climate conditions may reduce carbon uptake in this LCP ecosystem.",
