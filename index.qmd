I'm an avid programmer.  I am fluent in Python and functionally proficient in a number of other languages including JavaScript, R, and Matlab.  I love making maps and enjoy creating interactive, web-based applications for research and education.  I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my research and pedagogical philosophies.
